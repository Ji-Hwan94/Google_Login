        <h2>Arsenal</h2>
            <a> 
                Arsenal is not just any old football club. It is a by-word for history, tradition and success.
                The century or so since the club's formation in 1886 has been littered with trophies – including 13 League titles – while some of football's greatest names have graced the Club.
                Off the pitch, legendary manager Herbert Chapman helped Arsenal dominate its sport in the 1930s while Arsène Wenger transformed the club with his own revolutionary methods. On the pitch, world-class talents like Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp have followed in the footsteps of terrace heroes such as Charlie George and Tony Adams.
                Arsenal’s glorious history is inextricably linked with its spirtual home, Highbury, but a new era is well underway since the Club's move to Emirates Stadium in 2006. It’s a reminder that Arsenal is not just about the past and present. It is very much a club for the future too.
